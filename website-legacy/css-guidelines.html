                            <li>In properties, put a space after, but not before, the : character.</li>

                              border-radius:50%;

                        <h3>Good</h3>
                        <pre>
                          .avatar {
                            border-radius: 50%;
                            border: 2px solid white;
                          }

                          .one,
                          .selector,
                          .per-line {
                            // ...
                          }
                        </pre>

                        <h2>Single declarations</h2>
                        <p>In instances where a rule set includes only one declaration, consider removing line breaks for readability and faster editing. Any rule set with multiple declarations should be split to separate lines.</p>

                        <pre>
                          /* Single declarations on one line */
                          .span1 { width: 60px; }
                          .span2 { width: 140px; }
                          .span3 { width: 220px; }
                        </pre>

                        <h2>Comments</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prefer line comments (// in Sass-land) to block comments.</li>
                            <li>Prefer comments on their own line. Avoid end-of-line comments.</li>
                            <li>Write detailed comments for code that isn't self-documenting:
                                <li>Uses of z-index</li>
                                <li>Compatibility or browser-specific hacks</li>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>ID selectors</h2>
                        <p>While it is possible to select elements by ID in CSS, it should generally be considered an anti-pattern. ID selectors introduce an unnecessarily high level of specificity to your rule declarations, and they are not reusable.</p>
                        <p>For more on this subject, read CSS Wizardry's article on dealing with specificity</p>

                        <h2>JavaScript hooks</h2>
                        <p>Avoid binding to the same class in both your CSS and JavaScript. Conflating the two often leads to, at a minimum, time wasted during refactoring when a developer must cross-reference each class they are changing, and at its worst,
                            developers being afraid to make changes for fear of breaking functionality.</p>
                        <p>We recommend creating JavaScript-specific classes to bind to, prefixed with .js-:</p>

                        <pre>
                        &lt;button class="btn btn-primary js-request-to-book"&gt;Request to Book&lt;/button&gt;
                      </pre>

                        <h2>Border</h2>
                        <p>Use 0 instead of none to specify that a style has no border.</p>

                        <h3>Bad</h3>
                        <pre>
                        .foo {
                          border: none;
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <h3>Good</h3>
                        <pre>
                        .foo {
                          border: 0;
                        }
                        </pre>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h1>SASS</h1>

                        <h2>Syntax</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use the .scss syntax, never the original .sass syntax</li>
                            <li>Order your regular CSS and @include declarations logically (see below)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Ordering of property declarations</h2>
                        <p><strong>Property declarations</strong></br>
                            List all standard property declarations, anything that isn't an @include or a nested selector.</p>

                        <pre>
                        .btn-green {
                          background: green;
                          font-weight: bold;
                          // ...
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <p><code>@include</code> <strong>declarations</strong></br>
                            Grouping <code>@includes</code> at the end makes it easier to read the entire selector.</p>
                        <pre>
                        .btn-green {
                         background: green;
                         font-weight: bold;
                         @include transition(background 0.5s ease);
                         // ...
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <p><strong>Nested selectors</strong></br>
                            Nested selectors, if necessary, go last, and nothing goes after them. Add whitespace between your rule declarations and nested selectors, as well as between adjacent nested selectors. Apply the same guidelines as above to your nested selectors.</p>

                        <pre>
                        .btn {
                          background: green;
                          font-weight: bold;
                          @include transition(background 0.5s ease);

                          .icon {
                            margin-right: 10px;
                          }
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <h2>Variables</h2>
                        <p>Prefer dash-cased variable names (e.g. <code>$my-variable</code>) over camelCased or snake_cased variable names. It is acceptable to prefix variable names that are intended to be used only within the same file with an underscore
                            (e.g. $_my-variable).</p>

                        <h2>Mixins</h2>
                        <p>Mixins should be used to DRY up your code, add clarity, or abstract complexity--in much the same way as well-named functions. Mixins that accept no arguments can be useful for this, but note that if you are not compressing your
                            payload (e.g. gzip), this may contribute to unnecessary code duplication in the resulting styles.</p>

                        <h2>Extend directive</h2>
                        <p><code>@extend</code> should be avoided because it has unintuitive and potentially dangerous behavior, especially when used with nested selectors. Even extending top-level placeholder selectors can cause problems if the order of
                            selectors ends up changing later (e.g. if they are in other files and the order the files are loaded shifts). Gzipping should handle most of the savings you would have gained by using @extend, and you can DRY up your stylesheets
                            nicely with mixins.</p>

                        <h2>Nested selectors</h2>
                        <p>Do not nest selectors more than three levels deep!</p>

                        <pre>
                        .page-container {
                          .content {
                            .profile {
                              // STOP!
                            }
                          }
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <p>When selectors become this long, you're likely writing CSS that is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strongly coupled to the HTML (fragile) —OR—</li>
                            <li>Overly specific (powerful) —OR—</li>
                            <li>Not reusable</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Again: never nest ID selectors!</br>
                            If you must use an ID selector in the first place (and you should really try not to), they should never be nested. If you find yourself doing this, you need to revisit your markup, or figure out why such strong specificity is needed. If you are writing
                            well formed HTML and CSS, you should never need to do this.</p>

                        <h2>Operators in Sass</h2>
                        <p>For improved readability, wrap all math operations in parentheses with a single space between values, variables, and operators.</p>

                        <h3>Bad</h3>
                        <pre>
                        .element {
                          margin: 10px 0 @variable*2 10px;
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <h3>Good</h3>
                        <pre>
                        .element {
                          margin: 10px 0 (@variable * 2) 10px;
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <h2>Media query placement</h2>
                        <p>Place media queries as close to their relevant rule sets whenever possible. Don't bundle them all in a separate stylesheet or at the end of the document. Doing so only makes it easier for folks to miss them in the future. Here's
                            a typical setup.</p>

                        <pre>
                        .element { ... }
                        .element-avatar { ... }
                        .element-selected { ... }

                        @media (min-width: 480px) {
                          .element { ...}
                          .element-avatar { ... }
                          .element-selected { ... }
                        }
                        </pre>

                        <h1>Organization</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Organize sections of code by component.</li>
                            <li>Develop a consistent commenting hierarchy.</li>
                            <li>Use consistent white space to your advantage when separating sections of code for scanning larger documents.</li>
                            <li>When using multiple CSS files, break them down by component instead of page. Pages can be rearranged and components moved.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                </div>
            </main>
